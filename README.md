# Pear Tutoring

This is the MICDS entry which won first place for the 2016-2017 hackathon hosted by World Wide Technology.

## Technologies

We created an Angular 2 front-end which is hooked up to Firebase. Throughout the development process we used Slack for communication and GitHub projects to keep track of what features were in progress.

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.20-4.

## Development Server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Deploying

Run `npm run deploy` for Linux / OSX and `npm run deploy:win` for Windows. Before your first deployment, you must install Firebase tools by running `npm install -g firebase-tools` and log in using `firebase login`.

## Hackathon

The MICDS team won first place winning $10,000 for our school!
