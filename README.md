# Pear Tutoring

This is the MICDS entry which won first place for the 2016-2017 hackathon hosted by World Wide Technology. It was made over the course of 4 months in our free time. Pear Tutoring is basically "the Uber of peer tutoring."

> Pear Tutoring is a collaborative, peer-to-peer solution for bringing together tutors and tutees into one destination that allows for efficient scheduling and real-time collaboration on a synchronized whiteboard.

## Technologies

We created an Angular 2 front-end which is hooked up to Firebase. Throughout the development process we used Slack for communication and GitHub projects to keep track of what features were in progress.

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.20-4.

## Installation

First, [grab the latest version of node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Clone and navigate to the repository, and type `npm install -D` to download all dependencies.

## Development Server

For running the website locally, type `ng serve` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Deploying

One you're ready to deploy your changes to production, run `npm run deploy` on Linux/OSX or `npm run deploy:win` on Windows. Before your first deployment, you must install the Firebase CLI by running `npm install -g firebase-tools` and log in to your Google account added to the Firebase project using `firebase login`.
